Edit Page and View Source Buttons
=================================

All pages and posts have a <kbd>View source</kbd> button that links to the raw copy of the page's source code
(e.g. the Markdown source) for reference and an <kbd>Edit</kbd> button for quickly editing the page on GitHub
(very handy for correcting typos for example). Both buttons are in the page footer. Look at the footer at the
bottom of this page for an example.
