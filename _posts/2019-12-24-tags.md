Tags
====

You can assign tags to a page or post in Jekyll by adding a `tags` variable to its
YAML front matter. For example:

```yaml
---
tags: [foo, bar, Example Tag]
---
```

See [Categories and Tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories-and-tags)
in the Jekyll docs for more details.

When a post or page has tags they'll be listed in the metadata beneath the title.

Creating pages for tags to link to
----------------------------------

If your site has a page with the URL `/tags/foo/` then the `foo` tag will link to that
page.
You might use this page to [list all posts with the tag](../example-category/_posts/2019-12-22-post-lists.md#listing-posts-in-a-category).

The tag page's URL must be equal to the name of the tag with spaces replaced by
`-`'s and uppercase letters downcased. For example a tag named `Example Tag`
would match a page with a `/tags/example-tag/` URL.

You can create such a page by creating a `tags/example-tag.md` or
`tags/example-tag/index.md` file.
