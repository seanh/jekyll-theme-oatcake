Tags
====

[Jekyll supports tagging posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories-and-tags) by listing the
tags in the [YAML front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
at the top of the post's file, like this:

```yaml
---
tags: [hot, summer]
---
```

The theme renders tags next to posts in post listings. Each rendered tag next
to a post also links to that tag's section within [the tags page](../tags.md),
a page that lists all posts by tag.
