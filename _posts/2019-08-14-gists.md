GitHub Gists
============

You can embed [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) in pages using just the Gist ID like
this:

    {% raw %}{% include gist.html sha="c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d" %}{% endraw %}

Example:

{% include gist.html sha="c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d" %}

To render just a single file from a gist rather than the entire gist pass the
`file=` argument:

    {% raw %}{% include gist.html sha="49e543c05736ddbb7873240fa2a89767" file="README.markdown" %}{% endraw %}

Example:

{% include gist.html sha="49e543c05736ddbb7873240fa2a89767" file="README.markdown" %}

You can also use the `{% raw %}{% gist c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d %}{% endraw %}`
provided by the [jekyll-gist](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist) plugin
that's enabled by default on GitHub Pages, but the `gist.html` include makes
the gists wider than the main content of the post.
