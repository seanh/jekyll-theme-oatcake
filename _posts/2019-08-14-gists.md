GitHub Gists
============

To embed [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) in pages you can use the `{%
raw %}{% gist c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d %}{% endraw %}` provided by the
[jekyll-gist](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist) plugin that's enabled by
default on GitHub Pages, but this theme also provides a `gist.html` include
that makes the gists wider than the main content of the post.

To embed a wide gist:

    {% raw %}{% include gist.html sha="c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d" %}{% endraw %}

Example:

{% include gist.html sha="c08ee0f2726fd0e3909d" %}

To render just a single file from a gist rather than the entire gist pass the
`file=` argument:

    {% raw %}{% include gist.html sha="49e543c05736ddbb7873240fa2a89767" file="README.markdown" %}{% endraw %}

Example:

{% include gist.html sha="49e543c05736ddbb7873240fa2a89767" file="README.markdown" %}
