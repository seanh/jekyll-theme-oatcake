Drafts
======

You can create a draft post by adding `draft: true` to the post's YAML frontmatter
or by putting the post in a `_drafts/` directory instead of the `_posts/` directory.
Drafts won't appear in [post lists](./2019-12-22-post-lists.md) (generated by `{% raw %}{% include post_list.html %}{% endraw %}`)
by default and won't appear in the site's feed if using the [jekyll-feed plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed).
I recommend also adding `sitemap: false` and `robots: noindex, nofollow` to a
draft post's frontmatter to keep it out of the sitemap and search engines:

    ---
    draft: true
    sitemap: false
    robots: noindex, nofollow
    ---

    My Draft Post
    =============

    ...

You can render a list of all a site's draft posts by passing `drafts=true` to
`{% raw %}{% include post_list.html %}{% endraw %}`:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% include post_list.html drafts=true %}{% endraw %}
```

This can be used to create a [drafts page listing all your draft posts](../drafts.md)
(remember to put `sitemap: false` and `robots: noindex, nofollow` in the drafts page's own frontmatter too).
See [Post Lists](./2019-12-22-post-lists.md) for more on post listings.
