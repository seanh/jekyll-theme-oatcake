GitHub User Mentions and Avatars
================================

You can mention GitHub users by their `@name` and it'll be linked to their GitHub
user page: @seanh. (Provided by the [jekyll-mentions](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-mentions) plugin.)

Avatars
-------

You can also render people's GitHub avatars via the [jekyll-avatar](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-avatar)
plugin, like this: `{% raw %}{% avatar seanh %}{% endraw %}`:

{% avatar seanh %}

You can also pass a `size` argument to get a bigger avatar like this: `{% raw %}{% avatar seanh size=200 %}{% endraw %}`:

{% avatar seanh size=200 %}
