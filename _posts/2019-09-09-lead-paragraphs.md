Lead Paragraphs
===============

<p class="lead">
  Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus.
</p>

You can make a "lead" paragraph like the one above (stands out more than other
paragraphs) with a `<p class="lead">`. These can go anywhere on the page, not
just at the top of posts.
