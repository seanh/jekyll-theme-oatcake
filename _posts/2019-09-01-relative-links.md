Relative Links
==============

You can use relative links to other Markdown files in the source,
and the [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links)
plugin will convert them to links to the right pages.

For example to link to another post:

    [figure post](2019-06-30-figures.md)

That will render a link like this: [figures post](2019-06-30-figures.md).

You can also link to static pages:

    [posts page](../posts.md)

Renders to this: [posts page](../posts.md).
