Typographic Symbols
===================

Kramdown [converts `'`, `"`, `<<`, `>>`, `...`, `--`, and `---` into their equivalent typographic symbols](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#typographic-symbols):

* Single quotes (`'`) become 'fancy quotes'

* Double quotes (`"`) also become "fancy quotes"

* Fancy quotes can be disabled by escaping the quotes using `\`:
  \'non-fancy single quotes\', \"non-fancy double quotes\".

* `<<` and `>>` become a guillemets, <<like this>>.

  Guillements are used as quotation marks in some languages
  (Esperanto, French, Greek, Italian, Spanish, ...).

* `...` becomes an ellipsis, like this: ...

  Ellipses are used to show when something has been left out,
  for example when you've omitted some words from a quote:

  > Hamlet asked whether it was “nobler ... to suffer the slings and arrows
  > of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles.”

Dashes
------

* A single `-` is just a hyphen, it doesn't get converted.
  Hyphens are used for compound words like well-being or advanced-level.

* `--` becomes an en-dash, which is slightly longer than a normal hyphen, like this: --.

  En-dashes are used to indicate spans of time or ranges of numbers:
  July 9--August 17, or pp. 37--59.

  You can also combine words using en-dashes to indicate conflict, connection
  or direction:

  > The liberal--conservative debate never ends.  
  > The Perth--Dubai--⁠Boston flight takes more than a day.  
  > There is a north--⁠south railway in the same area as the highway that run east--west.  
  > <cite>[©&nbsp;2019&nbsp;thepunctuationguide.com](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html)</cite>

  You shouldn't put spaces before or after en-dashes.

* `---` becomes an em-dash, which is longer again than an em-dash, like this: ---

  Em-dashes create a strong break in the structure of a sentence, more emphatic
  than a comma or colon, and drawing attention to the information rather than
  suggesting that the information is unnecessary like parentheses do.  For
  example:

  > We bought pencils, rulers, notebook paper, pens, and folders---all of which
  > were on sale, of course---for our clients to use in the courtroom.
  > <cite>[Get&nbsp;It&nbsp;Write](https://getitwriteonline.com/articles/en-dashes-em-dashes)</cite>

  You can also use just one em-dash, instead of opening and closing ones, if
  the contained text is at the end of the sentence:

  > After months of deliberation, the jurors reached a unanimous verdict---guilty.
  > <cite>[©&nbsp;2019&nbsp;thepunctuationguide.com](https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html)</cite>

  Another use for em-dashes is when you can't use a comma to separate a parts of
  a sentence because the parts themselves contains commas:

  > After a split second of hesitation, the second baseman leaped for the
  > ball---or, rather, limped for it.
  > <cite>[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/dash/)</cite>

  You shouldn't put spaces before or after em-dashes.

  Em-dashes can also be used to indicate missing parts of a word:

  > Mr. J--- --- testified that the defendant yelled, “Die, a------,” before pulling the trigger.
