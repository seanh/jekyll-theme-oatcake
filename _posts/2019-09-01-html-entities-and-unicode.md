HTML Entities and Unicode
=========================

An & in the Markdown file gets changed into `&amp;` by Markdown.  
< and > get changed into `&lt;` and `&gt`.

You can enter [HTML entities](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref)
like `&copy;` and `&pound;` directly into the Markdown:
&copy;, &pound;, &sect;, &para;, &larr;, &rarr;, &hearts;, etc.

You can also paste unicode characters directly into the Markdown source and
they'll be rendered. Here's a few: ⌘ ⌥ ❄ ★ ☂
