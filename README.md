jekyll-theme-seanh
==================

My Jekyll theme, as used on [seanh.cc](https://seanh.cc/).
A very plain and simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
theme with a system font stack and hopefully decent typography. Has a lot of
typographical details like `<kbd>` and `<samp>` support, figures with captions,
and emojis.
